# gnosis.js

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This will also trigger a call to `npm run migrate`. See the Development section for more info about that.

Needs a Web3 provider to work. For testing, try TestRPC.

## Development

Before you begin, you will want to have the contracts deployed on the chain you plan to use. If not, run `npm run migrate`. The build process using Truffle will insert the chain locations in a `networks` key on the contract build artifacts.

### Building

You can run `npm run build` to build the library. Note that this will compile in all network information present in the build artifacts, including temporary network information generated by TestRPC during migrations. You may use `npm run netclean` to remove unofficial network info if desired.

### Running the dev server

Run `npm run dev` to run the dev server and serve the examples. The library source will be continuously recompiled. Examples will be available on http://localhost:8080. Don't forget to refresh the page after you change the source.

### Running the tests

Run `npm test` to run test suite.

### Running the docs

Run `npm run doc` to run and open the jsdocs in your browser.
